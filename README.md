# NLP-Speech-Recognition
• Determined how effective the Speech recognition tool using the Google API is in identifying words spoken by people with different accents based on different demographics such as age, birthplace, and native language.
• Designed a Data Visualization model using an interactive dashboard, with user controls, in Tableau. This analysis provides insights for comparing the Google API in speech recognition to the original phrase spoken by people from different demographic and linguistic backgrounds using average percentage of accuracy.
